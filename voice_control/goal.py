"""Goal mode: reach a multi-step goal with repeated Jev decisions, no generative model.

Each step reads the screen, then asks Jev, in one request, how likely it is
that the goal is already reached (a noul probability) and which action
primitive comes next, along with target choices (and, for typing, which words
of the goal to type). Large screens may need a grouped target request. The
action runs, the screen settles,
and the loop repeats with every earlier step described in the state, until the
done probability clears a threshold, Jev finds no useful action, the same
action stops changing anything, or the step budget runs out.

Screen reading and execution are passed in, so the app, the evaluation
harness, and offline tests share this loop.
